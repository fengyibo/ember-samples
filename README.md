Ember.js Examples
=================

The app contains some small examples that I put together while trying to learn [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)

Installation
------------

`bundle install`

`rake db:migrate`

`rake db:seed`

List of Examples
----------------

###Selectable Rows
In this example we render a table with many rows. You can select the rows and perform an action. 

###SlickGrid Integration
This example integrates Ember.js with [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid). The grid's data is populated with JSON from the server. All paging, sorting and filtering is done on the server side. 

###JQueryUI autocomplete Integration
This example integrates Ember with JqueryUI's [autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/) plugin. It also uses [EmberResource](https://github.com/staugaard/ember-resource) to load and perform updates on the selected record.
